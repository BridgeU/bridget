# bridget üí°
BridgeU‚Äôs style guide


## To-do
- [x] Write a few base [stories][1] as a start
- [x] Set a page-wide [decorator][2] for better-looking Storybook pages
- [x] Export package for production
- [ ] Export our Storybook as a [static app][0]
- [ ] Check [addons][4] and see if there is anything helpful there


## Features
- üîÅ Live reloading
- üì¶ Exportable


## Install
Run the following commands on your computer:

1. `git clone git@github.com:BridgeU/bridget.git`
1. `cd bridget`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run watch`

Your browser will open on [`http://localhost:9001`][0], where a local server
is running, keeping that page up to date. If you change any of the files at
`/src`, that page will update in a couple of seconds, allowing you to preview
your changes in almost real time.


## Export
Running `npm run build` will update `dist/` with our JavaScript and CSS, which
we should do every time we commit changes. This folder will contain the files
we‚Äôll import from other projects and allow us to reuse this style guide.
